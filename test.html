            Before the discord server, the most popular way to communicate about the upcoming course was on the facebook group chat, ran by a student with some sort of official relation to the university. A poll was done to see who should run the group chat and they were elected but the second most popular option went along the lines of "I only use discord bruh", an option made by Arun, primarily to see if there was a discord server, and secondly, to see the demand for one. About a week after this, Arun finally decided to make a discord server.
            The first few people to join the server got the invitation from this fairly small facebook group chat. Many of these members have the "Cheese Gang" role or "James" role and some were even allowed to become admins just by asking. The server was mostly themed around the James May cheese meme at the time with the icon being the thumbnail for the popular internet video.
        </p>
        <p>
            The server became very popular once the first online lecture began as the invitation link was posted in the chat, allowing more than 200 people to see the link, many of which joined. This large and sudden influx in members lead to the "First Great and Bountiful Era". This era was well known for its constant changes and upgrades to better facilitate the communication capabilities to help facilitate learning and socialisation. This was particually important given the circumstances caused by COVID-19. Social events were organised almost immedietly after the first surge occured. For the next couple of online lectures, large influxes of people would join as the invitation link got posted in chat, this was only helped by people needing to be more social online, wanting more help and of course, wanting QR codes. One of the admins setup a bot to convert the qr code image into a link which was and still is used in the <mark class=channel>#qr-codes</mark> channel. Eni and many others would consistently, without fail, ask for the qr code, often leaving soon after. Some people from the UEA CS Paper 98 server were beginning to get fustrated that they were getting qr codes for attendance without actually attending the lectures, so they made there own qr code. A link took them to the <a href="https://dowehavetheqrcodeyet.com/"> dowehavetheqrcodeyet</a> website. Once there, a qr code could be scanned, registering you on the SEX OFFENDERS register by using the same microsoft registration system to make it convincing. At the beginning of this era, it was usual to see 4 and later 5 members watching Death in Paradise, playing CSGO or a couple of other games but as more members joioned the almost daily voice chats, the night's entertainment was diversified. During this era, there was a minecraft realm setup by one of the most active members which around 10 people joined. This became an example of how having a bad admin can hinder the experience and enjoyment as the owner repeatedly cheated for personal gain. Arun used this to show how he was a much better leader to enforce his grip on the server.

            Around halfway through October, growth had began to slow down but more people were regularly joining voice calls, this is the "Settled Age of Comfort Era". Due to many of the active, sociable people on the server all knowing eachother a lot better, there was a call for another election, but this time, current admins could be unelected. This caused mild panic for the admins, including the server owner, Arun, who decided that democracy should be the way forward with the server, even if it meant him losing his power. He created an algorithm to elect a small group of people based on the amount of upvotes and downvotes their comment recieved and shared this on github for all to understand. He ended up getting re-elected along with most of the others from the admin team apart from Jack who was replaced with another Jack from the "Jacking Off" party. A minor change was made to the server with somewhat major effects when Arun decided that you have to have one of the four "Essential Roles" to access the majority of the server channels. These roles were "Maths A", "Maths B", "Buisness" and "Outsider" (originally called "non-computer science"). This meant that more people would be forced to get their roles and this also prompted people to get other roles using Nick's bot called "Botette Chin" but this also lead to many people not used to discord, complaining about not being able to see channels so Arun received many DMs asking how to access the server. Over time this issue was resolved and now, everyone has an "Essential Role" and most people have non-essential roles which meant mentioning groups of people would get more people allowing for more people to know about game sessions or meetups. Eventually this change was liked by many people for these reasons.
