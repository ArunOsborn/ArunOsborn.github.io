      In general, don't be a dick. If you're doing something that's upsetting other people, clearly we're going to have a problem.
      <ul>
         <li>Please don't spam, post NSFW or illegal content, or do anything that is against the Discord ToS.</li>
         <li>Please use each channel for its intended purpose.</li>
         <li>Do not private message members of this server for support unless they ask you to. We are all students too, and you will get a response much quicker asking in the proper channels.</li>
         <li>Be tolerant of people's differences. We all come from different backgrounds, and the expectation is for everyone to share a common respect for each other.</li>
