      <h2>Noteworthy Quotes<span id="Quotes"></h2>
      <p>Throughout its history, there have been many quotes from members and lecturers well known within the active community of the server.</p>

      <div>

         <h3>Jeannette's Quotes</h3>
         <p>As mentioned previously, there was a question asking if they could use Windows 98 and Jeannette replied with <q>WINDOWS 98??!</q>. This moment was deemed to be hilarious and became an inside meme so the server was renamed with reference to windows 98.</p>
         <p>A similar situation occured with the same lecturer but this time the question was along the line of <q>Can I use paper to do it?</q> and the lecturer, once again took the question seriously saying <q>PAPER??!</q>, effectively replacing the old meme and so the server was renamed <q>UEA CS Paper</q>.</p>
         <q>This is your freedom</q>
