      <h2>Icons<span id="Icons"></h2>
      The server has had multiple icons throughout the months, most lasting for around a month before being updated or replaced completely.

      <div id="icons">
         <h3>James May</h3>
         The first icon was the James May cheese thumbnail as this was popular with many members of the server at the time.

         <h3>Altered UEA Logo</h3>
         This was quickly changed to a photoshopped version of the official UEA icon with the words "Computer Science" added in to make the server look more useful for learning purposes and not just a meme server. <br><img src="https://db3pap006files.storage.live.com/y4miIfnpqB751TgMydz8hMOB59c6KgBuIWC2o-ctDkqtPc-JGZwnYhgAg6F1-ScvfDzIweHY7LkFMA6P_76ovltNGWp7lq25pyPlpt6iORxC1VqrfP-letKtl27VYJWHSRZyACKrMEXJS0CZYFg8v8CgZ-YHt6NpVD49ulsUWniSa5VVvbvm00ofMJEA6R6FJvV?width=559&height=559&cropmode=none"Altered UEA Logo>

         <h3>3D gif</h3>
         It was discovered that the server logo could now be a gif so Arun asked the admins if anyone could create a logo in the form of a moving gif but no one did so Arun decided to make one himself in Unity. There were multiple iterations of this logo changing angles and lighting conditions to make the text more clear. It was based off the official UEA logo with the words "Computer Science" underneath. <br><img src="https://db3pap006files.storage.live.com/y4m6cqTWhCvtZiCk6URSaolD26JDnmJApzNNjvQ_VE3c3pfjyYF4849E9ziXioLm5Z7O_qIugvcsbhvaPYSuW4eJQyDMv7GY3NigaFp42tC5aJ3S-AX-tjF0CmXMDH6b1uoI-rNmtbiNRBIJgApUW6q852UpuExIKj3Hqtbve5jT2_VYRiiTgEmh_xFEm15sH6R?width=524&height=462&cropmode=none"3D gif>

         <h3>Windows 98</h3>
         When the online lectures started, one of the lecturers took a humerous comment seriously. The post was a question asking if they could use Windows 98 and the lecturer replied with "WINDOWS 98??!". This moment was deemed to be hilarious and became an inside meme so the server was renamed with reference to windows 98. When discord nitro users boosted the server, the banner was enabled and a Windows 98 logo was used. Later on, the main lecturers were photoshopped inside of the four Windows 98 logo quadrants which became the new logo. <br><img src="https://db3pap006files.storage.live.com/y4mI_Ubjki5kT8XFwNgNFSTyF3C5Cp2mlTD7Okc7KPNUlLH2nNV1Z7Rio423olPoRZerwV2NyGmTknj9Do8BdFP4PGjcWZq5eNfldElgvisWnUECC-V_vtCJ6EnWnvL12P6bUyuJCyc54-nwsY7S1__sV05XZTLyQvVBiCAOC4LEevY7LU8Usz_jlj-Jl2iWTsb?width=256&height=256&cropmode=none"Windows 98>

         <h3>Paper 98</h3>
         A similar situation occured with the same lecturer but this time the question was along the line of "Can I use paper to do it?" and the lecturer, once again took the question seriously saying "PAPER??!", effectively replacing the old meme and so the server was renamed "UEA CS Paper". The icon was changed to a stack of paper and later on was made into a gif with the lecturer's faces in the Windows 98 logo printed on the paper. This remains the current logo today. <br><img src="UEA CS Paper.gif"Paper 98>
