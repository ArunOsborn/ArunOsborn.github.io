            <p>
               The original owner of the server. Now back as owner and causing havoc as he makes a series of stupid decisions.

            <p>
               Technically the most qualified as the Head of the Computer Science Society and course representative and has made some of the best custom emotes. Always has some anime profile picture.

               Won his position with memes. Always has the same ghostly profile picture.

            <p>
               Was once owner but gave it "temporarily" to Arun so he can have a break from the server. Now he influences decisions from outside the server.
            </p>

         <h2>Dom</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/459369678100234251/85c3ed93652aea552b6b698ae2c8779d.webp?size=80" class="pp">

               A man with many stories, Dom is the one who seems to know everything about everything.

            <p>
               An admin who has actually proven to be a fair and helpful admin when he's active - which is not much, especially when he was suspended.
            </p>

            <p>
               The newest admin who hasn't previously been admin. Hasn't done much yet but judge people.
