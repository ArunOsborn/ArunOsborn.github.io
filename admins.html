         <p>
            The official owner of the server since the 1st February 2021 after posting a video that surppased all other entries in the election. Doesn't accept to critisism <i>or</i> praise. I think that means he's strong minded? Went on a break from the server, leaving Mawer in charge. He since rejoined and is finally back as owner, holding an election as he became owner to keep his promise to Arun to keep the server democratic.
         </p>

         <h2>Jack Mawer (AKA The "Temporary" Owner Admin)</h2>

            <p>
               The previous owner of the server who was only supposed to have temporary ownership whilst Luke had some time off. Had proven to be a fair and helpful admin when he's actually active.
            </p>

         <h2>Charis</h2>

            <p>
               The only admin who is also a course representative and has made some of the best custom emotes. Always has an anime profile picture.
            </p>
         
         <h2>Ish</h2>

            <p>
               Won the recent election by posting a meme. Always has the same ghostly profile picture.
