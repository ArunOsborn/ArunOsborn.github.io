            <p>
               The original owner of the server. Now re-elected and ready to revert the server back to how he left it, with a few changes.

            <p>
               Technically the most qualified as the Head of the Computer Science Society and course representative and has made some of the best custom emotes. Always has some anime profile picture.

            <p>
               Was once owner but gave it "temporarily" to Arun so he can have a break from the server.

         <h2>Dom</h2>

               A man with many stories, Dom is the one who seem to know everything about everything.

            <p>
               An admin who has actually proven to be a fair and helpful admin when he's active - which is not much, especially now he is suspended.
