         <h2>Jack Mawer (AKA The Innactive Admin)</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/98397534816329728/428713d953d5cc1701619adb41c58a19.webp?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               The current owner of the server, passed on from Ben. Has proven to be a fair and helpful admin when he's actually active.
            </p>

         <h2>Ben Smith (AKA Spirit Admin)</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/293415777665679361/0956cadb09aad18033f8c6af02d95c1c.webp?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               The previous owner of the server since the 1st February 2021 after posting a video that surppased all other entries in the election. Doesn't accept to critisism <i>or</i> praise. I think that means he's strong minded? Currently on a break from the server, leaving Mawer in charge.
            </p>

         <h2>Lukasz (AKA The-One-Who's-Still-Admin Admin)</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/276839486741151757/d305c8fdf63f75462fbed6f4ced3b7d8.webp?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               Has somehow been admin since the first day of the server despite not actually doing anything anyone has ever noticed. Has made comments about stepping down from admin.
            </p>         

         <h2>Nick (AKA The Bot Maker)</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/127415620793794560/a_22fd5ce9300aaceb9488b9734f302365.gif?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               Made the extremely useful Botette Chin allowing for qr-code scanning for registration, reaction roles and server statistics. He's also active and uncontroversial. But he's a weeb.
            </p>

         <h2>Charis</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/292429686976413706/294a2932228493e7b10ead6ed9c8a716.webp?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               The only admin who is also a course representative and has made some of the best custom emotes. Always has an anime profile picture.
            </p>

         <h2>Jack Hobby (AKA Self Proclaimed Shitty Admin)</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/273155862208708608/00904a426c420fdb3bb9e89f6a062b82.webp?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               Got elected by accident and constantly makes self-depricating jokes. Is rumoured to have made Ben's outstanding election video.
            </p>

         <h2>Ish</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/390219410461294592/776c48a62a9274ce137c95b344d81197.webp?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               Won the recent election by posting a meme. Always has the same ghostly profile picture.
            </p>

         <h2>Charlie</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/548197412347445254/c32a61c9b19dfd483423051eaa69bfb9.webp?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               Won the recent election by posting a meme. He's called Jugger on the server but Drugger might be more suitable.
