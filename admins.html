         <h2>Jack Mawer (AKA The Innactive Admin)</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/98397534816329728/428713d953d5cc1701619adb41c58a19.webp?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               The current owner of the server, passed on from Ben. Has proven to be a fair and helpful admin when he's actually active.
            </p>

         <h2>Ben Smith (AKA Spirit Admin)</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/293415777665679361/a_3535a8c23afce96dd0a0f608a6607fee.gif?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               The previous owner of the server since the 1st February 2021 after posting a video that surppased all other entries in the election. Doesn't accept to critisism <i>or</i> praise. I think that means he's strong minded? Currently on a break from the server, leaving Mawer in charge.
            </p>

         <h2>Lukasz (AKA The-One-Who's-Still-Admin Admin)</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/276839486741151757/a_f25fab3f67750dc3f3f10d3dcd21cc49.gif?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               Has somehow been the only admin since the first day of the server still in power (if you forget Nick), despite not actually doing anything anyone has ever noticed. Has made comments about stepping down from admin.
            </p>         

         <h2>Nick (AKA The Bot Maker)</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/127415620793794560/a_4967e5bf6c73b74428c035bd219d24d5.gif?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               Made the extremely useful Botette Chin allowing for qr-code scanning for registration, reaction roles and server statistics. He's also active and uncontroversial. But he's a weeb.
            </p>

         <h2>Charis</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/292429686976413706/f362b73176a7fb1ce92e67e5de6d9ac1.webp?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               The only admin who is also a course representative and has made some of the best custom emotes. Always has an anime profile picture.
            </p>

         <h2>Jack Hobby (AKA Self Proclaimed Shitty Admin)</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/273155862208708608/00904a426c420fdb3bb9e89f6a062b82.webp?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               Got elected by accident and constantly makes self-depricating jokes. Is rumoured to have made Ben's outstanding election video.
            </p>

         <h2>Ish</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/390219410461294592/776c48a62a9274ce137c95b344d81197.webp?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               Won the recent election by posting a meme. Always has the same ghostly profile picture.
            </p>

         <h2>Charlie</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/548197412347445254/8931982227f39aaaab053d9dcd9a5063.webp?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               Won the recent election by posting a meme. He's called Jugger on the server but Drugger might be more suitable.
            </p>
