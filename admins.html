            <p>
               The original owner of the server. Now back as owner and causing havoc as he makes a series of stupid decisions.

            <p>
               Technically the most qualified as the Head of the Computer Science Society and course representative and has made some of the best custom emotes. Always has some anime profile picture.

            <p>
               Was once owner but gave it "temporarily" to Arun so he can have a break from the server. Now he influences decisions from outside the server.
            </p>

         <h2>Dom</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/459369678100234251/85c3ed93652aea552b6b698ae2c8779d.webp?size=80" class="pp">

               A man with many stories, Dom is the one who seems to know everything about everything.

            <p>
               An admin who has actually proven to be a fair and helpful admin when he's active - which is not much, especially when he was suspended.

            <p>
               The newest admin who hasn't previously been admin. Hasn't done much yet but judge people.
