         <p>
            The official owner of the server since the 1st February 2021 after posting a video that surppased all other entries in the election. Doesn't accept to critisism <i>or</i> praise. I think that means he's strong minded? Went on a break from the server, leaving Mawer in charge. He since rejoined and is finally back as owner, holding an election as he became owner to keep his promise to Arun to keep the server democratic.
         </p>

         <h2>Jack Mawer (AKA The "Temporary" Owner Admin)</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/98397534816329728/a_42016c89ed38a6020014f03b0e523b5e.gif?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               The previous owner of the server who was only supposed to have temporary ownership whilst Luke had some time off. Had proven to be a fair and helpful admin when he's actually active.
            </p>

         <h2>Charis</h2>

            <p>
               The only admin who is also a course representative and has made some of the best custom emotes. Always has an anime profile picture.
            </p>

         <h2>Lukasz (AKA The-One-Who's-Still-Admin Admin)</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/276839486741151757/a_aee7361ddbf40c24434da3510f7e3a6a.gif?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               Has somehow been the only admin since the first day of the server still in power (if you forget Nick), despite not actually doing anything anyone has ever noticed. Has made comments about stepping down from admin but since called dropping out a move "for pussies". he is incredibly based.
            </p>         

         <h2>Nick (AKA The Bot Maker)</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/127415620793794560/a_4967e5bf6c73b74428c035bd219d24d5.gif?size=128" class="pp">
            <p>
               Made the extremely useful Botette Chin allowing for qr-code scanning for registration, reaction roles and server statistics. He's also active and uncontroversial. But he's a weeb.
            </p>
         
         <h2>Ish</h2>

            <p>
               Won the recent election by posting a meme. Always has the same ghostly profile picture.
            </p>

         <h2>Charlie</h2><p>
               Left the server on the 29th June for unknown reasons but still techincally remains an admin. Won the recent election by posting a meme. He's called Jugger on the server but Drugger might be more suitable.
