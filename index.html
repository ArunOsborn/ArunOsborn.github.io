         <h2>Introduction<span id="Introduction"></h2>
            <p>
               The UEA CS Paper 98 group is primarily a group of computer scientists from UEA. It is well know for producing the UEA CS Paper 98 Discord Server on the 15th of September 2020 A.D.. It was originally setup by Arun Osborn, who owned the server until the 1st February 2021 beofre transfering ownership to Ben Smith.
            </p>

         <h2>Early Era<span id="Early Era"></h2>
            <p>
               Before the discord server, the most popular way to communicate about the upcoming course was on the facebook group chat, ran by a student with some sort of official relation to the university. A poll was done to see who should run the group chat and they were elected but the second most popular option went along the lines of "I only use discord bruh", an option made by Arun, primarily to see if there was a discord server, and secondly, to see the demand for one. About a week after this, Arun finally decided to make a discord server.
               The first few people to join the server got the invitation from this fairly small facebook group chat. Many of these members have the "Cheese Gang" role or "James" role and some were even allowed to become admins just by asking. The server was mostly themed around the James May cheese meme at the time with the icon being the thumbnail for the popular internet video.
            </p>

         <h2>The First Great and Bountiful Era<span id="The First Great and Bountiful Era"></h2>
            <p>
               The server became very popular once the first online lecture began as the invitation link was posted in the chat, allowing more than 200 people to see the link, many of which joined. This large and sudden influx in members lead to the "First Great and Bountiful Era". This era was well known for its constant changes and upgrades to better facilitate the communication capabilities to help facilitate learning and socialisation. This was particually important given the circumstances caused by COVID-19. Social events were organised almost immedietly after the first surge occured. For the next couple of online lectures, large influxes of people would join as the invitation link got posted in chat, this was only helped by people needing to be more social online, wanting more help and of course, wanting QR codes. One of the admins setup a bot to convert the qr code image into a link which was and still is used in the <mark class=channel>#qr-codes</mark> channel. Eni and many others would consistently, without fail, ask for the qr code, often leaving soon after. Some people from the UEA CS Paper 98 server were beginning to get fustrated that they were getting qr codes for attendance without actually attending the lectures, so they made there own qr code. A link took them to the <a href="https://dowehavetheqrcodeyet.com/"> dowehavetheqrcodeyet</a> website. Once there, a qr code could be scanned, registering you on the SEX OFFENDERS register by using the same microsoft registration system to make it convincing. At the beginning of this era, it was usual to see 4 and later 5 members watching Death in Paradise, playing CSGO or a couple of other games but as more members joioned the almost daily voice chats, the night's entertainment was diversified. During this era, there was a minecraft realm setup by one of the most active members which around 10 people joined. This became an example of how having a bad admin can hinder the experience and enjoyment as the owner repeatedly cheated for personal gain. Arun used this to show how he was a much better leader to enforce his grip on the server.

         <h2>Settled Age of Comfort Era<span id="Settled Age of Comfort Era"></h2>
            <p>
               Around halfway through October, growth had began to slow down but more people were regularly joining voice calls, this is the "Settled Age of Comfort Era". Due to many of the active, sociable people on the server all knowing eachother a lot better, there was a call for another election, but this time, current admins could be unelected. This caused mild panic for the admins, including the server owner, Arun, who decided that democracy should be the way forward with the server, even if it meant him losing his power. He created an algorithm to elect a small group of people based on the amount of upvotes and downvotes their comment recieved and shared this on github for all to understand. He ended up getting re-elected along with most of the others from the admin team apart from Jack who was replaced with another Jack from the "Jacking Off" party. A minor change was made to the server with somewhat major effects when Arun decided that you have to have one of the four "Essential Roles" to access the majority of the server channels. These roles were "Maths A", "Maths B", "Buisness" and "Outsider" (originally called "non-computer science"). This meant that more people would be forced to get their roles and this also prompted people to get other roles using Nick's bot called "Botette Chin" but this also lead to many people not used to discord, complaining about not being able to see channels so Arun received many DMs asking how to access the server. Over time this issue was resolved and now, everyone has an "Essential Role" and most people have non-essential roles which meant mentioning groups of people would get more people allowing for more people to know about game sessions or meetups. Eventually this change was liked by many people for these reasons.

         <h2>The Cold Winter<span id="The Cold Winter"></h2>
            <p>
               By mid December, most of the course for 2020 had finished and many members had returned home for Christmas, meaning they were spending much more time with their family and consequently, less time engaging with the server. This lead to "The Cold Winter" where the people regularly online drastically changed. This meant R6S was being played more and there were no more watch parties. It was around this time that a <mark class=channel>#question-of-the-day</mark> channel was suggested which Arun rightfully said belongs in a dead serve but was still implemented due to his love of democracy.<br>
               During the dark days when the server was mostly only active in the <mark class=channel>#general</mark> channel, the <mark class=channel>#question-of-the-day</mark> channel looked more and more like a desperate attempt to keep the server alive so Arun, the sole contributer to questions, decided to not prioritise updating the questions. About a week after Christmas Day, activity increased again as people had less time to, or got tired of talking to their families.
               <br><br>
               One of the most popular events during this time was a quiz night, suggested and made by an active member of the server. The server had many quiet days as some members were talking to their old friends or just too tired to join voice calls so the quiz nights were small, but shining glimmers of what the server had been prior to the cold winter and what it will be once again. A couple more people started joining the server during this time, many of which were friends of people on the server to fill slots in games and just to have more people on the server in general. This was a result of their being not many people active on the server at this time and people wanting to catch up with their old friends outside of University.

         <h2>The Age of Social Chaos<span id="The Age of Social Chaos"></h2>
            <p>
               After a new election was called for by many active members of the server, Arun reluctantly decided to hold one. Little did he know that it would lose him his power. The growing meme culture and want for change for the ssake of change meant lead to some odd results never seen before in an election. On January 31st 2021 at 5pm, Arun announced that he had been voted out, replaced by two new admins, Ben and Jack, as well as the other admins being re-elected. This marked the beginning of a new age. An experimental age where anything could happen. Watch a vide <a href="https://youtu.be/0qf22ircZkU">here</a> to find out more.<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0qf22ircZkU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
               <br><br>
               The proceding day marked the first day of the new semester so the server became much more active, which in turn lead to chaos so the new admins sprang into action. There were some actions made which many considered to be harsh punishment and there was an outcry for the return of Arun, but he just watched as his old server came to terms with the new age. The age that they voted for.
               <br><br>
               With the new semester came new subjects which meant new lecturers. The legend of Pierre from the Maths A module was seen by everyone in Computing Principles. There was also a huge influx (around 30 people) of new members as more buisness students were invited to the server as they shared many of the modules. There was some backlash from some people with more purist views but adjustments were made to facilitate the buisness modules. In many ways, the server had returned to its previous state, with voice calls for people in common lectures and a highly active general chat. The only key difference was that everyone had now gotten use to eachother and memes about evrything and everyone were being spread, which arguably was the main reason for Arun's loss. Before 4pm the day after the election, Ben was given ownership of the server as a few admins agreed and because he had the highest score of any candidate.<strong> Arun's last wish was that there should be another election in April and the candidate with the highest score will become the next owner.</strong> It turned out that a few permissions were set wrong for commands, according to the new admin team. This included people with the "Cheese Gang" role being able to honour people giving them the noblemun role for around 3 days. This would then let them pleb anyone they wanted. Arun set this as a test to see if anyone noticed but it was only discovered when Arun used it as a joke and it actually worked. This may have caused suspicion of Arun giving himself additional permissions after he demoted himself and the backdoor command didn't help with this suspicion as it allowed anyone to become admin by doing the command /backdoor although this was assumed to be removed before it was ever used.
               <br><br>
               Ben hadn't previously taken a strong stance on his views on memes in general so when the issue arrose, he decided to side with the loudest voices, letting them post memes in general, adding a <mark class=channel>#sh*t-posting</mark> channel and many other channels to spread out and divide the conversations. This lead to memes being spammed during particually boring lectures and on the 8th of February 2021, a 6 hour long slowmode was activated in <mark class=channel>#general</mark> as an emergency act to stop the meme spam. This was reduced to 5 seconds but for many people, it was still 6 hours because it wasn't setup correctly. More and more channels were created including <mark class=channel>#cars</mark>, <mark class=channel>#our-chronological-history</mark> (where you can find this article), <mark class=channel>#computer-stuff</mark> and channels for all the games that there are roles for. This brought up complaints, even from within the admin team. To fix the problem of having many channels visible to all the members, roles were added so people could select what they saw.
               <br><br>
               An incident occured one night during a game of jackbox, where a group of around five people randomly joined the server and the voice call. At first they seemed relatively friendly, asking about which flats people were staying in at UEA but it soon went down hill as some of these people used the f slur, offending some of the gay people in the call. They were warned before Ben kicked them from the server. This was the first incident of hate on the server so rules were quickly written to state that the f slur and n slur were not allowed. This was met with praise however, the bot used to write the rules was changed by a member who wasn't an admin and they also changed a few other rules. Whilst this wasn't negative, some joked about it showing signs of weakness for Ben and a bit of nostalgia was shown for the days of Arun's rule.
