         <h3>Reasons why I should be admin:</h3>
         <mark>This year, its going to be hot nerd summer. Meaning that yall if i am elected will receive this FUNDAMENTAL rights you deserve.</mark>
         <ul>
            <li>Pledge Number 1: I will allow the use of External Emojis onto ALL channels, you paid for nitro you deserve to use it.</li>
            <li>Pledge Number 2: I will cut down on the cringe in general and other areas, making sure that everyone is happy with what is going on.</li>
            <li>Pledge Number 3: If I become admin, my hair may become ginger.</li>
            <li>Pledge Number 4: As a third party, I will make sure that your rights to democracy are upheld and an election happens WHEN its supposed to, instead of that being supressed.</li>
            <li>Pledge Number 5: I will throw away the use of Plebbing unless there is an actual reason to be plebbed... I.e be cameron.</li>
            <li>Pledge Number 6: I promise to make sure that better events are hosted, and to engage people more.</li>
            <li>Pledge Number 7: Its time we threw away the mistakes of the past, i.e making Hobby Admin... Its time for a new time of freedom in the server.</li>
         </ul>

         <p>
            To conclude this presentation, I hope you have all had a great time in Comp Sci this year, regardless on whether you plan on voting or not, and i hope the server has been a good place for you to gather and voice your opinions
            and thoughts as well as assist others with work. With many villians like the Jarring Jeanette and Bitchrez, and who could forgot the Exam google translated about 7 times in order to get the questions into english, i hope the
            server has become a safe place of refuge now and for many months to come.
         </p>
